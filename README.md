# Game Feedback

- Developed an application that implements CRUD functionality for
            posts and comments and replies, providing users with an interactive
            experience.

- Utilized MongoDB as a backend for efficient data storage and
            retrieval.

- Crafted using the Next.js React framework and styled with SCSS for a
            modern and visually appealing interface.
